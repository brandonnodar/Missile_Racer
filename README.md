## About the Project
<p>The purpose of the game is to be the first missile to hit the enemy on the other side</p>

<p>(Add gif of missiles about to hit enemy)</p>

## AI Missile
<p>The AI has been programmed to follow a set of waypoints. The waypoints adjust based on the AI's missile performance (how fast it can go), and the difficulty (how closely the AI takes the turns).</p>

<p>(Add gif of AI taking turn (in scene view within Unity, showing waypoints and triggers).

## Missile Garage
<p>The garage allows you to change, upgrade, and customize your missile.</p>
<p>Features of the garage include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>30 missiles to choose from.</li>
  <li>4 performance upgrades.</li>
  <li>5 paint jobs for each missile.</li>
  <li>130 different thrusters and explosion styles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each missile saves it's state of selected upgrade, body color, thruster, and explosion settings.</p>
